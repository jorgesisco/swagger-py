About
-----
Swagger.py is a Python library for using
[Swagger](https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/) defined API's.

Swagger itself is best described on the Swagger home page:

    Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for
    describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web
    services.

The [Swagger specification](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki) defines
how API's may be described using Swagger.

Swagger.py also supports a WebSocket extension, allowing a WebSocket to
be documented, and auto-generated WebSocket client code.
